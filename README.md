# Problem description
1. Write a function which takes a matrix as argument and an integer as parameter which can be a 1 or a 2. If the user entered a matrix with a parameter other than 1 or 2 do the following:
 	- If matrix is rectangular (more rows), add to each row its corresponding row index
 	- If matrix is rectangular (more columns), add to each column its corresponding column index
 	- If matrix is square, transpose with respect to secondary diagonal
	- If the user enterd a matrix and a paramter 1 or 2, do the following
 		- If the parameter is 1, sort the diagonal in ascending order, then return the input and sorted matrices
 		- If the parameter is 2, sort the diagonal in descending order, then return the input and sorted matrices
2. Write a script which generates a random matrix and tests all possible cases
	- with no parameter entered, just the matrix
 		- more rowsðŸ‰‘
 		- more columnsðŸ‰‘
 		- square
	- with parameter other than 1 or 2
 		- more rowsðŸ‰‘
 		- more columnsðŸ‰‘
 		- square
	- with parameter 1
		- more rowsðŸ‰‘
 		- more columnsðŸ‰‘
 		- square
	- with parameter 2
 		- more rowsðŸ‰‘
 		- more columnsðŸ‰‘
 		- square

*** Side note **
The test cases set above add up to 12, but in the problem statement only 6 were requested. I am not going to write code that is not properly tested so I added uncovered cases myself. The ones that were requested are marked with "ðŸ‰‘". \
A few things are not mentioned in the testing portion of the problem. What are hard limits on matrix dimentions? Should they be tested if they are correct in the script or just computed and returned, then verified by the user?\
Additionally, I do not understand some parts of the program. What is "transpose with respect to the
secondary diagonal"?\
